1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") for styling. It will contain DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and manipulation.

2. "styles.css": This is the custom CSS file for the website. It will contain styles that are not covered by Tailwind CSS. It will use class names and id names that match those in the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file. It will contain utility classes that can be used in the "index.html" file for styling. It will also contain custom styles defined using Tailwind's @apply directive.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the CSS files for styling specific elements.

2. Class Names: These are identifiers that can be used on multiple elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the CSS files for styling groups of elements.

3. CSS Selectors: These are used in the CSS files to select and style elements in the "index.html" file. They can be element names, class names, id names, or other types of selectors.

4. Media Queries: These are used in the CSS files to apply different styles depending on the characteristics of the device displaying the website (such as screen width). They can affect how styles are applied in the "index.html" file.

5. CSS Variables: These are used in the CSS files to store values that can be reused throughout the file. They can be used in multiple places in the CSS files and in the "index.html" file.

6. HTML Tags: These are used in the "index.html" file to structure the content of the website. They can be styled using the CSS files.

7. Tailwind Utility Classes: These are used in the "index.html" file to apply styles from the "tailwind.css" file. They can be used in multiple places in the "index.html" file and in the "styles.css" file using Tailwind's @apply directive.
